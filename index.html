              Mathematics, the science of structure, order, and relation that
              has evolved from elemental practices of counting, measuring, and
              describing the shapes of objects. ... All mathematical systems
              (for example, Euclidean geometry) are combinations of sets of
              axioms and of theorems that can be logically deduced from the
              axioms.
