              radioactivity. As the first of the Curie family legacy of five
              Nobel Prizes, she was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the
              first person and the only woman to win the Nobel Prize twice, and
              the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two scientific fields.

              Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior
              of matter. It is a natural science that covers the elements that
              make up matter to the compounds composed of atoms, molecules and
              ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the
              changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances.
