              Richard Phillips Feynman was an American theoretical physicist,
              known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum
              mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, the physics of
              the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as his
              work in particle physics for which he proposed the parton model.
              For contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics,
              Feynman received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 jointly with
              Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichirō Tomonaga.
